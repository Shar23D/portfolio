# ♞ Anti-Knight Sudoku

A fully interactive web-based Sudoku game — with a twist. This variant includes the **anti-knight constraint**, which forbids placing the same number in any square that is a chess knight's move away. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Classic 9x9 Sudoku board
- ♞ Anti-Knight Constraint: No repeating digits on knight moves (like in chess)
- ✍️ Note-taking mode
- 💡 Smart hints system
- 🔁 Reset and difficulty selection (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- ⌨️ Full keyboard support (navigation, input, quick actions)
- 🧠 Solution validator
- ⏱️ Timer and hint counter
- 🎨 Light/Dark mode toggle
- 📱 Fully responsive design

## 🎮 Game Rules

This Sudoku variant includes an **anti-knight rule**:

> In addition to the standard rules of Sudoku (each row, column, and 3x3 box must contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once), **no two identical digits may be a knight’s move apart**, as in chess.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Puzzle Generator**: A full Sudoku board is first solved using backtracking.
- **Puzzle Carving**: Cells are removed one by one while ensuring a unique solution remains.
- **Anti-Knight Validation**: During both generation and gameplay, the anti-knight rule is enforced in addition to standard constraints.
- **Hints**: Randomly fill one incorrect or empty cell with the correct value from the solved puzzle.
- **Timer & Hints Counter**: Updated every second and on each hint use.
