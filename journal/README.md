## Space Journal

Space Journal is an interactive journaling experience where users can write their worries, crumple them, and launch them into symbolic cosmic targets — like a black hole or the sun — to let them go. The journey is visual, animated, and message-driven, blending mindfulness with playful design.

## Features

Multi-phase flow:

- Journal entry

- Slingshot launch

- Flight animation

- Completion with a randomized message

- Responsive UI with dynamic CSS transitions and animations

- Modular JavaScript architecture

- Custom targets (trash, fire, tornado, sun, black hole), each with their own:

- Emoji and animation

- Power threshold

- Inspirational/funny messages

## Setup
1. Clone or Copy Files

Ensure you have the entire folder structure intact, especially:

floating-icon/ assets and JS

js/ files with ES module support

2. Run Locally

Just open index.html in a modern browser.

No build tools or servers required.

## How It Works
### Journal Phase

User types their feelings into a textarea.

When text is detected, the “Crumple & Launch” button becomes enabled.

On click, the paper crumples and the UI transitions to the next phase.

### Slingshot Phase

User holds the mouse down on the paper ball to charge power.

The more power, the further the paper flies.

Targets are tied to power ranges (0–100%).

### Flight Phase

The paper flies across the screen.

The selected target becomes animated.

An explosion of particles signifies impact.

### Completion Message

A themed message is randomly selected and shown.

User can click "Write Another Entry" to restart the cycle.

Name	  Power Range	    Emoji      Duration     Particle Color	    Messages
Trash	     0–20	         🗑️         4000ms          Gray                3
Fire	     20–40	         🔥         4500ms          Orange              3
Tornado	     40–60	         🌪️         4500ms          Light Blue          3
Sun	         60–80	         ☀️         5000ms          Yellow              3
Black Hole	 80–100	         🕳️         6000ms          Purple              3
```

## Built With

HTML5: Semantic layout and structure

CSS3: Animations, transitions, responsive design

JavaScript (ES6 Modules):

- SpaceJournal: Main controller class

- JournalPhase: Handles user input

- SlingshotPhase: Launch mechanism

- FlightPhase: Paper and target animation

- CompletionMessage: End message handling

- Targets: Target logic and messages

- StarField: Starry background generator

## Reusability & Extensibility

You can reuse or adapt this experience by:

Adding more targets to Targets.js

Customizing CSS animations per phase

Replacing the flying paper mechanic with other metaphors (e.g., bottle in the ocean, balloon release)
 
Integrating persistence (e.g., saving entries locally or remotely)

## Dev Notes

JavaScript events are managed with a basic .on() / .emit() pub/sub pattern.

Flight and particle animations are done using pure CSS, dynamically triggered via JS.

Tooltips and floating buttons are added dynamically from a shared folder.

## Floating Icon Integration

To include the floating icon tooltip (e.g., for returning to homepage):

Include in <head>:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../floating-icon/floating-icon.css" />
<script src="../floating-icon/floating-icon.js" defer></script>
```
Make sure the file paths are correct based on your structure.
